# QuickChatter

*A chat application created for the "Build & Connect Challenge" event in a Discord server called Developers Hangout*

***To run the source code, clone the project in Visual Studio

You should run 1 QuickChatter.Server and 2 QuickChatter.Client (3 apps in total)

With this setup, you can test it out and chat with yourself (you lonely f*ck)

If needed, you can change the port of the server where it listens to (QuickChatter.Server.program.cs line 17) into any port you prefer

If any questions or problems, leave them in the issues section

Thank you.

PS: This project was purely for the event and will probably have some bugs. It was done in the spare time of the developer
